# AI-Enhanced-Wetland-Monitoring-EWS
Protecting Lesotho's fragile alpine wetlands requires multi-scale monitoring. We integrate satellite/UAV remote sensing with AI/ML for classification and prediction. Crucially, community reporting ensures data validity. This creates a decision support framework for early warning and sustainable management.
